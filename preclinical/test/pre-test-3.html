        opts: ["2 to 4 blades", "6 to 10 blades", "12 to 40 blades", "Over 50 blades"],
        correct: 2,

    },
    {
        q: "Why is it recommended to run a sterilized handpiece for a few seconds before patient use?",

        q: "To minimize pulpal trauma, the most critical factor to control during high-speed cutting is:",
        opts: ["The brand of the bur", "The use of air-water spray coolant", "The grip on the handpiece", "The room temperature"],
        correct: 1,
        explain: "Air-water spray is essential to dissipate the significant heat generated by high-speed friction, thereby protecting the pulp."
    },

        q: "What is the primary function of the blades on the head of a carbide bur?",
        opts: ["To polish the tooth surface", "To abrade the enamel", "To cut or shear away tooth structure", "To carry water coolant"],
