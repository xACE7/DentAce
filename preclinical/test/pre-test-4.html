  {q:"Common materials/approaches for deeper cavities as pulp protection include:", opts:["Liners and bases","Pins only","Amalgam varnish only","Orthodontic bands"], correct:0, explain:"Liners and bases are placed for deeper cavities requiring protection."},
  {q:"Secondary resistance and retention features may include ALL EXCEPT:", opts:["Retention locks and grooves","Pins","Skirts","Beveling of all margins for amalgam"], correct:3, explain:"Secondary features include locks, grooves, skirts, slots, pins—not universal beveling for amalgam."},
  {q:"A slot preparation is BEST categorized as a:", opts:["Primary retention feature","Secondary mechanical retention feature","Convenience form feature","Finishing step"], correct:1, explain:"Slots are added as secondary mechanical features in compound/complex preparations."},
  {q:"Beveling enamel margins in composite preparations is PRIMARILY indicated for:", opts:["Small preventive resin restorations only","Large restorations needing increased retention and esthetics","All amalgam restorations","All Class I composites regardless of size"], correct:1, explain:"Bevels are mainly for larger composite restorations with increased retention needs."},
