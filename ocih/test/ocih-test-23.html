  { q: "The CEJ marks the border between the anatomical crown and the:", opts: ["Pulp chamber", "Gingiva", "Anatomical root", "Clinical crown"], correct: 2, explain: "The Cementoenamel Junction is the line at which the enamel of the crown and the cementum of the root meet." },
  { q: "In which situation does cementum formation continue throughout life?", opts: ["Only during tooth development", "It stops after eruption", "To compensate for occlusal wear and maintain tooth position", "Only if the tooth is damaged"], correct: 2, explain: "Cellular cementum is deposited throughout life, especially at the apex, to compensate for enamel wear." },

];

const tfs = [
  { q: "Acellular cementum is primarily located on the apical one-third of the root.", answer: false, explain: "False. Acellular cementum is on the coronal two-thirds; cellular cementum is on the apical third." },
  { q: "Cementocytes are located within spaces called lacunae.", answer: true, explain: "True. Cementocytes, the cells of cellular cementum, reside in lacunae." },
  { q: "In the 'gap' type of CEJ, dentin is exposed to the oral environment.", answer: true, explain: "True. The failure of enamel and cementum to meet results in exposed dentin." },
  { q: "Tomes' granular layer is a structural component of the cementum.", answer: false, explain: "False. Tomes' granular layer is found in the outermost layer of root dentin, not cementum." },
  { q: "Cellular cementum is generally thinner and more mineralized than acellular cementum.", answer: false, explain: "False. Cellular cementum is thicker and less mineralized than acellular cementum." },
  { q: "The incremental lines of Salter indicate a pause in the rhythmic deposition of cementum.", answer: true, explain: "True. These lines represent the appositional growth pattern of cementum." },
  { q: "The most common relationship at the CEJ is an edge-to-edge meeting of enamel and cementum.", answer: false, explain: "False. The most common type is cementum overlapping enamel (about 60% of cases)." },

const saqs = [
  { q: "Define cementum and state its two main functions.", a: "Cementum is a collagen-based mineralized tissue that covers the dentin of the root. Its two main functions are: 1. To provide attachment for the periodontal ligament fibers, anchoring the tooth in its socket. 2. To repair minor root surface damage and adapt to occlusal changes." },
  { q: "List the three types of Cementoenamel Junction (CEJ) arrangements in order of prevalence, from most common to least common.", a: "The three types of CEJ arrangements are: <br>1. <strong>Overlap Type:</strong> Cementum overlaps the enamel (Most common, ~60%). <br>2. <strong>Edge-to-Edge Type:</strong> Cementum meets the enamel in a sharp line (Second most common, ~30%). <br>3. <strong>Gap Type:</strong> A space exists between cementum and enamel, exposing dentin (Least common, ~10%)." },

  { q: "A patient complains of sharp pain on their mandibular premolar when drinking cold water. A clinical examination reveals gingival recession but no signs of decay. Based on the histology of the CEJ, what is the most likely structural cause for this sensitivity?", a: "The most likely cause is a <strong>'Gap Type' CEJ</strong>. The gingival recession has exposed the CEJ, and in this specific arrangement, there is a space between the enamel and cementum, leaving the underlying dentinal tubules exposed. This exposure allows thermal stimuli (like cold water) to directly affect the pulp, causing sharp pain." },
  { q: "Describe the histological structures seen at the Dento-Cemental Junction (DCJ), starting from the dentin and moving outwards to the cementum.", a: "The structures at the DCJ are: <br>1. <strong>Root Dentin:</strong> Characterized by dentinal tubules. <br>2. <strong>Tomes' Granular Layer:</strong> A distinct granular-appearing area within the outermost layer of root dentin. <br>3. <strong>Hyaline Layer of Hopewell-Smith:</strong> A thin, clear, structureless layer that lies on top of the Tomes' granular layer. <br>4. <strong>Cementum:</strong> The outermost layer, which is attached to the hyaline layer." },
  { q: "What are cementocytes? Describe their location and key morphological features as seen under a microscope.", a: "Cementocytes are the cells of cellular cementum that have become trapped in the matrix they produced. <br><strong>Location:</strong> They are found within small spaces called <strong>lacunae</strong>, exclusively in cellular cementum. <br><strong>Morphology:</strong> Under a microscope, they appear as dark, spider-like or star-shaped bodies (the cell body in the lacuna) with numerous thin processes called <strong>canaliculi</strong> extending outwards, typically towards the periodontal ligament." }
