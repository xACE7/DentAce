    { q: "Which component of the X-ray tubehead is a leaded glass vacuum tube?", opts: ["The X-ray tube housing", "The transformer", "The PID", "The leaded-glass housing of the X-ray tube"], correct: 3, explain: "The X-ray tube itself is housed within a leaded-glass vacuum tube to prevent X-rays from escaping in all directions." },
    { q: "What is the fundamental unit of matter?", opts: ["Molecule", "Ion", "Atom", "Electron"], correct: 2, explain: "The atom is the fundamental unit of all matter." },

    { q: "In which type of interaction does the incident photon cease to exist without causing ionization, only momentarily exciting an outer shell electron?", opts: ["Photoelectric absorption", "Compton scattering", "Coherent scattering", "Bremsstrahlung"], correct: 2, explain: "In Coherent (Thomson) scattering, a low-energy photon passes near an outer electron, exciting it, and then scatters in a different direction with the same energy without causing ionization." }

It produces a continuous spectrum of X-ray energies.</li><li><b>Characteristic Radiation:</b> Produced when a high-speed electron dislodges an electron from an inner shell of a target atom.

    { q: "A dental assistant notices that recent radiographs are coming out too dark. They are using a setting of 70 kVp and 10 mA. What single setting could they adjust to make the radiographs lighter, and in which direction should they adjust it?", a: "To make the radiographs lighter (less dense), the assistant should decrease the total exposure. The easiest single setting to adjust is the <b>exposure time</b>. They should <b>reduce the exposure time</b>. Alternatively, they could reduce the mA, but time is more commonly adjusted." },
    { q: "Describe the function of the two main components of the cathode in an X-ray tube.", a: "<ol><li><b>Filament (Tungsten):</b> Serves as the source of electrons. When heated by the electric current (determined by mA), it emits electrons through thermionic emission.</li><li><b>Focusing Cup (Molybdenum):</b> Electrostatically focuses the cloud of electrons from the filament into a narrow beam and directs it towards the focal spot on the anode.</li></ol>" },
    { q: "Explain the Inverse Square Law as it applies to dental radiography.", a: "The Inverse Square Law states that the intensity of the X-ray beam is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the source. This means that if you double the distance from the X-ray tube to the patient/film, the beam's intensity will be reduced to one-quarter of its original strength." }
