  { q:"Optimal fixed dosing interval IN THEORY is:", opts:["Equal to one half‑life","Equal to two half‑lives","Irrelevant to half‑life","Equal to time to peak"], correct:0, explain:"Theory suggests dose interval ≈ t½; practicality may limit this for very short t½." },

  { q:"A drug that becomes more hydrophilic after hepatic processing has most likely undergone:", opts:["Phase I oxidation followed by Phase II conjugation","Only Phase I reduction to a more lipophilic product","Phase III transport","Exclusive pulmonary metabolism"], correct:0, explain:"Common sequence: Phase I → introduce handle; Phase II → conjugate → hydrophilic." },
  { q:"Which statement about Phase II metabolites is MOST accurate?", opts:["Usually more water‑soluble and therapeutically inactive","Always pharmacologically active","Less polar than parent drugs","Always excreted in bile"], correct:0, explain:"Conjugation usually yields polar, inactive products; route depends on properties." },
  { q:"Non‑microsomal enzymes are typically:", opts:["Not inducible and may show genetic polymorphism","Highly inducible by barbiturates","Confined to smooth ER","Exclusive to hepatic tissue"], correct:0, explain:"Non‑microsomal (cytosol/mitochondria/plasma) often not inducible; polymorphism exists." },
  { q:"Which combination correctly pairs CYP example with class?", opts:["CYP2D6 – microsomal P450","Esterase – microsomal P450","Amidase – microsomal P450","CYP – peroxisomal catalase"], correct:0, explain:"CYP2D6 is a microsomal cytochrome P450 isoform." },
  { q:"A weak base in acidic urine is expected to be:", opts:["More ionized and thus excreted more","Less ionized and reabsorbed more","Unaffected by pH","Converted to a weak acid"], correct:0, explain:"Acidic urine protonates weak bases → ionized → less reabsorption → more excretion." },
  { q:"Which factor is LEAST likely to shorten a drug's half‑life?", opts:["Extensive tissue uptake","Rapid metabolism","Rapid excretion","High protein binding"], correct:3, explain:"High protein binding tends to prolong half‑life; the others shorten it." },
  { q:"Which clinical implication follows from knowing t½?", opts:["Helps choose dosing interval and anticipate accumulation/toxicity","Determines mechanism of action","Predicts exact efficacy in every patient","Eliminates need for monitoring"], correct:0, explain:"Half‑life guides dosing intervals and risk of accumulation vs. under‑dosing." },
  { q:"A drug highly reabsorbed from distal tubules is MOST likely:", opts:["Lipophilic and non‑ionized","Strongly acidic and fully ionized","A quaternary ammonium compound","Conjugated with sulfate"], correct:0, explain:"Lipophilicity and non‑ionized state promote passive reabsorption." },
  { q:"Which organ set contains both significant metabolic and excretory roles?", opts:["Liver and kidney","Spleen and thyroid","Bone and cartilage","Adipose and skin"], correct:0, explain:"Liver (metabolism, bile) and kidney (excretion) are central to disposition." },
  { q:"During multiple dosing, subsequent doses are given to:", opts:["Raise concentrations to peaks around a target range","Avoid any fluctuation in concentration","Keep concentration constant at all times","Reduce bioavailability progressively"], correct:0, explain:"Lecture notes: subsequent doses raise levels toward a peak within therapeutic range." }
