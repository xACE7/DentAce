  {q:"Which is NOT listed as a determinant of absorption?",opts:["Gastric/intestinal pH","Presence of food","Mesenteric blood flow","Hepatic enzyme induction"],correct:3,explain:"Slide 14 lists dosage form, food, GI composition, pH, mesenteric flow, co‑administered drugs—not hepatic induction."},

  {q:"A patient with severe hypoalbuminemia is MOST likely to have:",opts:["Decreased free fraction of acidic drugs.","Increased unbound drug leading to enhanced effect/toxicity.","Improved tissue binding lowering effect.","No change in distribution."],correct:1,explain:"Slide 24: Plasma proteins affect movement; low albumin increases free drug."},
  {q:"Which factor primarily determines regional distribution after systemic absorption?",opts:["Cardiac output and regional blood flow.","Gastric pH.","Urinary pH.","Degree of drug ionization only."],correct:0,explain:"Slide 24 lists cardiac output and regional blood flow as additional factors."},
  {q:"Which route MOST reliably avoids first‑pass metabolism?",opts:["Oral","Rectal (upper rectum)","Sublingual","Enteral via NG tube"],correct:2,explain:"Sublingual drains to systemic circulation, bypassing portal flow; slide 20–22."},
  {q:"Which pair is CORRECT regarding emergency drug delivery alternatives?",opts:["ET always provides equivalent absorption as IV.","IO offers rapid access when IV is not available, especially in pediatrics.","SC is faster than IV for rapid resuscitation.","Rectal is preferred for cardiac arrest."],correct:1,explain:"Slide 9: IO is an emergency alternative, especially in children; IV remains preferred."},
  {q:"Which change would MOST likely INCREASE the rate of oral absorption?",opts:["Co‑administration with a drug that slows gastric emptying.","Formulation with faster disintegration/dissolution.","High‑fat meal before dosing sildenafil.","Severe migraine with gastroparesis."],correct:1,explain:"Slides 15–17,19: Faster disintegration/dissolution increases absorption rate."},
  {q:"A drug with poor solubility is expected to have:",opts:["High oral bioavailability.","Low oral bioavailability.","No effect on bioavailability.","Higher first‑pass metabolism."],correct:1,explain:"Slide 16: Poor solubility = low bioavailability."},
  {q:"Which statement about pharmacokinetics is MOST accurate?",opts:["It excludes distribution once the drug reaches blood.","It encompasses absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion.","It deals only with dosing frequency.","It is synonymous with pharmacodynamics."],correct:1,explain:"Slides 11–13: PK includes ADME."},
  {q:"Which enteral route places medication between cheek and gum?",opts:["Sublingual","Buccal","Rectal","Orogastric"],correct:1,explain:"Slide 8: Buccal is between cheek and gum; similar to sublingual."},
  {q:"Which best explains why IV administration provides 100% bioavailability?",opts:["It bypasses dissolution.","It avoids first‑pass and delivers drug directly into systemic circulation.","It increases protein binding.","It avoids renal excretion."],correct:1,explain:"Slide 17: IV dosing is 100% bioavailable because it enters blood directly."},
  {q:"Which oral drug from the list is MOST compromised by first‑pass metabolism, requiring larger oral than parenteral doses?",opts:["Verapamil","Cefazolin","Heparin","Insulin"],correct:0,explain:"Slide 22: Propranolol, salbutamol, verapamil undergo substantial first‑pass; others are not given orally (heparin/insulin)."}
