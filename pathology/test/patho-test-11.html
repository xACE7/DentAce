    q: "Which cytokine is mentioned as playing a key role in the pathogenesis of bone tuberculosis?",
    opts: ["Interleukin-10 (IL-10)", "Transforming Growth Factor-beta (TGF-β)", "Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF)", "Interferon-gamma (IFN-γ)"],

  },
  {
    q: "In adults, after the epiphyseal plate closes, infection in a long bone is typically confined to the metaphysis.",

    q: "A long-term risk of chronic osteomyelitis includes the development of amyloidosis and squamous cell carcinoma in sinus tracts.",
