    "q": "All inflammatory mediators are derived from cells at the site of injury.",
    "answer": false,
    "explain": "Slide 11 clarifies that mediators can be either cell-derived (like histamine) or plasma-derived from the liver (like bradykinin and complement)."

    "q": "An abscess is defined as a diffuse, widespread collection of pus in the tissues.",

    "q": "Monocytes migrate from the bloodstream into tissues to become macrophages.",
    "answer": true,
    "explain": "Slide 9 mentions that monocytes go to the tissue to become macrophages, which are also involved in the inflammatory process."

    "a": "<b>Suppurative Inflammation</b> is characterized by the production of pus, a thick exudate containing dead neutrophils, necrotic cells, and microbes. A classic example is a <b>dental abscess</b>.<br><br><b>Serous Inflammation</b> is characterized by a thin, watery, low-protein exudate. It represents a milder form of injury. A common example is the fluid found in a <b>skin blister after a burn</b>."

These chemical mediators act on the thermostatic center in the brain, raising the body's temperature set-point.<br><br><b>High WBC Count (Leukocytosis):</b> Inflammatory mediators, particularly interleukins, stimulate the bone marrow to accelerate the production and release of white blood cells (especially neutrophils) into the circulation."
