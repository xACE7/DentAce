    q: "Epithelioid cells within a granuloma are a type of activated lymphocyte.",
    answer: false,
    explain: "False. Epithelioid cells are activated macrophages that have developed abundant cytoplasm, resembling epithelial cells."
  },
  {
    q: "The cytokine Interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) is primarily responsible for activating macrophages.",
    answer: true,
    explain: "True. IFN-γ, secreted by activated T-cells, is the key mediator that activates macrophages and drives granuloma formation."
  },
  {
    q: "All granulomatous diseases are characterized by central caseous necrosis.",
    answer: false,
    explain: "False. While diseases like tuberculosis cause caseating granulomas, others like leprosy or sarcoidosis typically form non-caseating granulomas."

  {
    q: "Fever is a systemic effect of inflammation mediated by the release of prostaglandins.",
    answer: true,

    q: "Define chronic inflammation, highlighting its three key simultaneous processes.",
    a: "Chronic inflammation is an inflammatory response of prolonged duration (weeks to years) that is provoked by the persistence of causative stimuli. The three key processes that occur simultaneously are: 1. Active inflammation, 2. Tissue injury/destruction, and 3. Healing/repair attempts (e.g., fibrosis)."

    q: "List three distinct causes of chronic inflammation.",
    a: "Three major causes of chronic inflammation are: <br>1. <b>Persistent infections</b> by microbes that are difficult to eradicate, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis or certain viruses. <br>2. <b>Immune-mediated inflammation</b>, including autoimmune diseases where the body attacks its own tissues, or allergic diseases. <br>3. <b>Prolonged exposure to toxic agents</b>, either exogenous (like silica) or endogenous (like lipid components)."

    q: "What is granulomatous inflammation, and what is its histologic hallmark?",
